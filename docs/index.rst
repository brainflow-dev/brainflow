Welcome to BrainFlow's documentation!
=======================================

BrainFlow is a library intended to obtain, parse and analyze EEG, EMG, ECG and other kinds of data from biosensors.

It provides a **uniform data acquisition API for all supported boards**, it means that you can switch boards without any changes in code and applications on top of BrainFlow are board agnostic. Also there is **powerful API to perform signal processing** which you can use even without BCI headset. Both of these two APIs are the same across bindings.
