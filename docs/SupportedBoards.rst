BrainFlow Dummy Boards
------------------------

Playback File Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This board playbacks files recorded using other BrainFlow boards.

**It allows you to test signal processing algorithms on real data without device.**

To create such board you need to specify the following board ID and fields of BrainFlowInputParams object:

- :code:`BoardIds.PLAYBACK_FILE_BOARD`
- :code:`master_board`, it should contain board ID of the device used to create playback files
- :code:`file`, it should contain full path to recorded file
- *optional:* :code:`file_aux`, use it if your master board has auxiliary preset
- *optional:* :code:`file_anc`, use it if your master board has ancillary preset

Initialization Example:

.. code-block:: python

    params = BrainFlowInputParams()
    params.file = "streamer_default.csv"
    params.file_aux = "streamer_aux.csv"
    params.master_board = BoardIds.SYNTHETIC_BOARD
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.PLAYBACK_FILE_BOARD, params)

Supported platforms:

- Windows >= 8.1
- Linux
- MacOS
- Devices like Raspberry Pi

By default it generates new timestamps and stops at the end of the file. You can override such behavior using commands:

.. code-block:: python

    board.config_board ("loopback_true")
    board.config_board ("loopback_false")
    board.config_board ("new_timestamps")
    board.config_board ("old_timestamps")

In methods like:

.. code-block:: python

    get_eeg_channels (board_id)
    get_emg_channels (board_id)
    get_ecg_channels (board_id)
    # .......


You need to use master board id instead Playback Board Id, because exact data format for playback board is controlled by master board as well as sampling rate.

Streaming Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BrainFlow boards can stream data to different destinations like file, socket, etc directly from BrainFlow. This board acts like a consumer for data streamed from the main process.

To use it in the first process(master process, data provider) you should call:

.. code-block:: python

    # choose any valid multicast address(from "224.0.0.0" to "239.255.255.255") and port
    add_streamer ("streaming_board://225.1.1.1:6677", BrainFlowPresets.DEFAULT_PRESET)

In the second process you shoud create Streaming board instance and this process will act as a data consumer.

To create such board you need to specify the following board ID and fields of BrainFlowInputParams object:

- :code:`BoardIds.STREAMING_BOARD`
- :code:`ip_address`, for example above it's 225.1.1.1
- :code:`ip_port`, for example above it's 6677
- :code:`master_board`, it should contain board ID of the device used to create playback files
- *optional:* :code:`ip_address_aux`, use it if your master board has auxiliary preset
- *optional:* :code:`ip_port_aux`, use it if your master board has auxiliary preset
- *optional:* :code:`ip_address_anc`, use it if your master board has ancillary preset
- *optional:* :code:`ip_port_anc`, use it if your master board has ancillary preset

Initialization Example:

.. code-block:: python

    params = BrainFlowInputParams()
    params.ip_port = 6677
    params.ip_port_aux = 6678
    params.ip_address = "225.1.1.1"
    params.ip_address_aux = "225.1.1.1"
    params.master_board = BoardIds.SYNTHETIC_BOARD
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.STREAMING_BOARD, params)

Supported platforms:

- Windows >= 8.1
- Linux
- MacOS
- Devices like Raspberry Pi
- Android

In methods like:

.. code-block:: python

   get_eeg_channels (board_id)
   get_emg_channels (board_id)
   get_ecg_channels (board_id)
   # .......

You need to use master board id instead Streaming Board Id, because exact data format for streaming board is controlled by master board as well as sampling rate.

If you have problems on Windows try to disable virtual box network adapter and firewall. More info can be found `here <https://serverfault.com/a/750820>`_.

Synthetic Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This board generates synthetic data and you dont need real hardware to use it.

**It can be extremely useful during development.**

To create such board you need to specify the following board ID and fields of BrainFlowInputParams object:

- :code:`BoardIds.SYNTHETIC_BOARD`

Initialization Example:

.. code-block:: python

    params = BrainFlowInputParams()
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.SYNTHETIC_BOARD, params)

Supported platforms:

- Windows >= 8.1
- Linux
- MacOS
- Devices like Raspberry Pi
- Android

To use this board you need to get `BLED112 dongle <https://www.silabs.com/wireless/bluetooth/bluegiga-low-energy-legacy-modules/device.bled112>`_.

**On Unix-like systems you may need to configure permissions for serial port or run with sudo.**

To create such board you need to specify the following board ID and fields of BrainFlowInputParams object:

- :code:`BoardIds.MUSE_2016_BLED_BOARD`
- :code:`serial_port`, e.g. COM3, /dev/ttyACM0
- *optional:* :code:`serial_number`, device name, can be printed on the Muse device or discoovered via mobile apps

Initialization Example:

.. code-block:: python

    params = BrainFlowInputParams()
    params.serial_port = "COM3"
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.MUSE_2016_BLED_BOARD, params)

Supported platforms:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux
- Devices like Raspberry Pi

Available :ref:`presets-label`:

- :code:`BrainFlowPresets.DEFAULT_PRESET`, it contains EEG data
- :code:`BrainFlowPresets.AUXILIARY_PRESET`, it contains Gyro and Accel data, enabled by default
