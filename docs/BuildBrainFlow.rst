Installation Instructions
==========================

Precompiled libraries in package managers(Nuget, PYPI, etc)
-------------------------------------------------------------

Core part of BrainFlow is written in C/C++ and distributed as dynamic libraries, for some programming languages we publish packages with precompiled libraries to package managers like Nuget or PYPI.

C/C++ code should be compiled for each CPU architecture and for each OS and we cannot cover all possible cases, as of right now we support:

- x64 libraries for Windows starting from 8.1, for some devices newer version of Windows can be required
- x64 libraries for Linux, they are compiled inside manylinux docker container
- x64/ARM libraries for MacOS, they are universal binaries

If your CPU and OS is not listed above(e.g. Raspberry Pi or Windows with ARM)  you still can use BrainFlow, but you need to compile it by youself first. See :ref:`compilation-label` for details.

Python
-------

.. compound::

    Please, make sure to use Python 3+. Next, install the latest release from PYPI with the following command in terminal ::

        python -m pip install brainflow

.. compound::

    If you want to install it from source files or build unreleased version from Github, you should first compile the core module (:ref:`compilation-label`). Then run ::

        cd python_package
        python -m pip install -U .

C#
----

**Windows(Visual Studio)**

You are able to install the latest release from `Nuget <https://www.nuget.org/packages/brainflow/>`_ or build it yourself:

- Compile BrainFlow's core module
- Open Visual Studio Solution
- Build it using Visual Studio
- **Make sure that unmanaged(C++) libraries exist in search path** - set PATH env variable or copy them to correct folder

**Unix(Mono)**

- Compile BrainFlow's core module
- Install Mono on your system
- Build it using Mono
- **Make sure that unmanaged(C++) libraries exist in search path** - set LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable or copy them to correct folder

.. compound::

    Example for Fedora: ::

        # compile c++ code
        python tools/build.py
        # install dependencies, we skip dnf configuration steps 
        sudo dnf install nuget
        sudo dnf install mono-devel
        sudo dnf install mono-complete
        sudo dnf install monodevelop
        # build solution
        xbuild csharp_package/brainflow/brainflow.sln
        # run tests
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/andreyparfenov/brainflow/installed/lib/
        mono csharp_package/brainflow/examples/denoising/bin/Debug/denoising.exe

R
-----

R binding is based on `reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>`_ package and calls Python code, so you need to install Python binding first, make sure that reticulate uses correct virtual environment, after that you will be able to build R package from command line or using R Studio, install it and run samples.

Java
-----

You are able to download jar files directly from `release page <https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/releases>`_

.. compound::

    If you want to install it from source files or build unreleased version from github you should compile core module first (:ref:`compilation-label`) and run ::

        cd java_package
        cd brainflow
        mvn package

Also, you can use `GitHub Package <https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/packages/450100>`_ and download BrainFlow using Maven or Gradle.
To use Github packages you need to `change Maven settings <https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-apache-maven-for-use-with-github-packages>`_. `Example file <https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/blob/master/java_package/brainflow/settings.xml>`_  here you need to change OWNER and TOKEN by Github username and token with an access to Github Packages.

Matlab
--------

Steps to setup Matlab binding for BrainFlow:

- Compile Core Module, using the instructions in :ref:`compilation-label`. If you don't want to compile C++ code you can download Matlab package with precompiled libs from `Release page <https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/releases>`_
- Open Matlab IDE and open brainflow/matlab_package/brainflow folder there
- Add folders lib and inc to Matlab path
- If you want to run Matlab scripts from folders different than brainflow/matlab_package/brainflow you need to add it to your Matlab path too
- If you see errors you may need to configure Matlab to use C++ compiler instead C, install Visual Studio 2017 or newer(for Windows) and run this command in Matlab terminal :code:`mex -setup cpp`, you need to select Visual Studio Compiler from the list. More info can be found `here <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/choose-c-or-c-compilers.html>`_.

Julia
--------

BrainFlow is a registered package in the Julia general registry, so it can be installed via the Pkg manager:

.. compound::

    Example: ::

        import Pkg
        Pkg.add("BrainFlow")
        
When using BrainFlow for the first time in Julia, the BrainFlow artifact containing the compiled BrainFlow libraries will be downloaded from release page automatically.

If you compile BrainFlow from source local libraries will take precedence over the artifact.

Rust
-------

.. compound::

    You can build Rust binding locally using commands below, but you need to compile C/C++ code first ::

        cd rust_package
        cd brainflow
        cargo build --features generate_binding

Docker Image
--------------

There are docker images with precompiled BrainFlow. You can get them from `DockerHub <https://hub.docker.com/r/brainflow/brainflow>`_.

All bindings except Matlab are preinstalled there.

Also, there are other packages for BCI research and development:

- mne
- pyriemann
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter
- pandas
- etc

If your devices uses TCP/IP to send data, you need to run docker container with :code:`--network host`. For serial port connection you need to pass serial port to docker using :code:`--device %your port here%`

.. compound::

    Example:  ::

        # pull container from DockerHub
        docker pull brainflow/brainflow:latest
        # run docker container with serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
        docker run -it --device /dev/ttyUSB0 brainflow/brainflow:latest /bin/bash
        # run docker container for boards which use networking
        docker run -it --network host brainflow/brainflow:latest /bin/bash
