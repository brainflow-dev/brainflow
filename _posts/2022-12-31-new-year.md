As we approach the end of 2022, it's time to take a moment to take stock of our achievements in 2022 and share our plans for 2023.

I'm very proud on how much traction BrainFlow has gained. Over the course of the year we significanly improved BrainFlow and implemented several crucial extenstions for the API such as:

* [Integration of onnxruntime](https://brainflow.org/2022-06-09-onnx/) which allows us and our customers to use ML models directly from Brainflow
* [Adding `BrainFlow Presets`](https://brainflow.org/2022-07-15-brainflow-5-1-0/) which allows us to integrate devices with variable sampling rates for different types of data easier

Of course we didn't forget about our main activity - extending BrainFlow by adding new devices:

* [Muse](https://brainflow.org/2022-05-16-muse-linux/)
* [Mentalab](https://brainflow.org/2022-09-10-mentalab/)
* [Emotibit](https://brainflow.org/2022-12-03-brainflow-5-5-0/)

As a results of all these efforts we crossed several awesome milestones:

* [100k Downloads from PYPI](https://brainflow.org/2022-05-25-100k-downloads/)
* [100 Dependent projects on Github](https://brainflow.org/2022-06-25-100-dependents/)

Also, we got really close to 1000 members in [our slack workspace](https://communityinviter.com/apps/openbraintalk/join-brainflow-on-slack). As of right now, there are 984 members. In addition to that number of stars on Github was increased from 500 to 833 and we are looking forward to crossing 1000 for both metrics next year. 

In 2023 we are going to extend the API even further by adding more signal processing methods and new devices, currently we are thinking about integration of boards from Neurosky and Bitalino, and of course we are open for feature requests.
