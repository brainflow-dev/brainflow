We’re excited to announce that **BrainFlow now supports the Galea device from [OpenBCI](https://openbci.com/)** — bringing seamless access to one of the most advanced multimodal neurotechnology headsets available today.

With this update, BrainFlow offers a unified and consistent API to stream, process, and analyze Galea data across all supported programming languages and platforms — including **Python, C++, C#, Java, Julia, JavaScript, Rust, Go, and MATLAB**.

You can now:

* **Stream data** from Galea using BrainFlow’s standard data acquisition interface.  
* **Access all sensor modalities** (EEG, EOG, EMG, PPG, IMU) through the same unified API.  
* **Use built-in BrainFlow filters and processing tools** for rapid prototyping and analysis.  
* **Integrate Galea** into your applications for BCI, neurofeedback, cognitive research, or immersive XR environments.

## What is Galea?

[Galea](https://galea.co/) is a cutting-edge wearable device that integrates **EEG (electroencephalography)**, **EOG (electrooculography)**, **EMG (electromyography)**, **PPG (photoplethysmography)**, and **IMU (inertial measurement)** sensors into a single head-mounted platform.  

Designed for research, neurotechnology development, and immersive experiences, Galea bridges the gap between **brain, body, and human–computer interfaces**. By combining multiple biosensing modalities with precise motion tracking, Galea enables developers, neuroscientists, and creators to capture richer physiological data for real-world neuroadaptive applications.

## Galea + BrainFlow: A Longstanding Collaboration

At BrainFlow, we’ve been closely involved in Galea’s development since its inception in 2021. This collaboration has driven several key innovations across both the BrainFlow and OpenBCI ecosystems. Some highlights include:

* The introduction of [**BrainFlow Presets**](https://brainflow.org/2022-07-15-brainflow-5-1-0/), originally designed to support Galea. This feature simplifies handling multiple data streams with different sampling rates. While Galea was the first device to benefit from it, the concept has since been extended to other devices such as **Muse** and **Explore** from Mentalab.  
* Expanded [**Unity integration**](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/GameEngines.html#unity) and the addition of **NuGet packages**, both influenced by Galea’s requirements for real-time multimodal streaming.  
* A **custom communication protocol** for Galea, developed through a joint effort between BrainFlow and OpenBCI.

In fact, BrainFlow was the **first SDK to support Galea**, though this functionality was previously limited to internal use. With this release, we’re excited to **make Galea support publicly available** to all developers and researchers.

## Getting Started with Galea in BrainFlow

Download the latest BrainFlow release (**v5.20.0**) for your preferred programming language.  
Below is a minimal **Python example** to get you started:

```bash
python -m pip install -U brainflow
```

Example: Streaming and Saving Data

```python
import time
from pprint import pprint
from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams, BrainFlowPresets, BoardIds
from brainflow.data_filter import DataFilter


def main():
    BoardShim.enable_dev_board_logger()

    params = BrainFlowInputParams()
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.GALEA_BOARD, params)
    board.prepare_session()
    board.start_stream()

    time.sleep(10)

    data_default = board.get_board_data(preset=BrainFlowPresets.DEFAULT_PRESET)
    data_aux = board.get_board_data(preset=BrainFlowPresets.AUXILIARY_PRESET)

    board.stop_stream()
    board.release_session()

    DataFilter.write_file(data_default, 'data_default.csv', 'w')
    DataFilter.write_file(data_aux, 'data_aux.csv', 'w')

    # Get channel and preset info
    for preset in BoardShim.get_board_presets(BoardIds.GALEA_BOARD):
        preset_description = BoardShim.get_board_descr(BoardIds.GALEA_BOARD, preset)
        pprint(preset_description)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The **default preset** contains EEG, EOG, and EMG data, while the **auxiliary preset** includes PPG, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, battery, and temperature data. Galea’s eye tracking data is accessed separately via pupil labs / Varjo.

## Conclusion

This integration strengthens BrainFlow’s mission to make biosensing and neurotechnology accessible, open, and developer-friendly.

By supporting Galea, we empower researchers and creators to build next-generation neuroadaptive systems without the burden of low-level hardware integration.
