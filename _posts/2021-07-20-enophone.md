BrainFlow will be the primary SDK to work with [Enophone](https://enophone.com/enophones/). Enophone headphones have active noise cancelling and four EEG electrodes.


#### Bluetooth library

To add Enophone devices we had to implement Bluetooth library, you can use it for other devices.

To build BrainFlow with bluetooth support you need to run `python tools\build.py --bluetooth` or use `-DBUILD_BLUETOOTH=ON` in CMake.

For Linux you may need to install package `libbluetooth-dev` or `bluez-libs-devel` depending on your distribution.
