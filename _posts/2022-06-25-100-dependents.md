Another cool milestone!


Now we have [100+ dependent projects](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/network/dependents) published on Github!

Most of them come from Python binding, but Github doesn't track Matlab, C++, etc packages which use BrainFlow, so real number is definitely bigger. Also, some of dependent projects are not publicly available and also not listed here. 

If you are working on an application that uses BrainFlow library and want to get more recognition for your work feel free to write about it in `#brainapps` channel in our slack workspace and propose it to be mentioned at [BrainFlow Gallery](https://brainflow.org/gallery/).
