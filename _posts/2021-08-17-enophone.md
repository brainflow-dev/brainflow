BrainFlow will be the primary SDK to work with [Enophone](https://enophone.com/enophones/). Enophone headphones have active noise cancelling and four EEG electrodes.

To establish connection with Enophone device you need to pair it first and find MAC address.

Steps to find MAC address:

* On Windows: open device manager, navigate to enophone device, click properties and select Bluetooth Address
* On Linux: install bluez-utils and run `bluetoothctl paired-devices`
* On MacOS: run `system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType`

*On Linux in order to compile and use it you may need to install `libbluetooth-dev` for Debian like systems and `bluez-libs-devel` for Fedora like.*

#### Bluetooth library

To add Enophone devices we had to implement Bluetooth library, you can use it for other devices.

To build BrainFlow with bluetooth support you need to run `python tools\build.py --bluetooth` or use `-DBUILD_BLUETOOTH=ON` in CMake.

For Linux you may need to install package `libbluetooth-dev` or `bluez-libs-devel` depending on your distribution.
