## Summary

* Add support for PiEEG - [729](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/pull/729). Thanks [Nick Gamb](https://github.com/nickgamb)!
* CentOS reached EOL, changes in minimum supported GLIBC version - [732](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/pull/732)

PiEEG (Measure EEG with RaspberryPi) – Brain-computer interface (EEG, EMG, and ECG bio-signals) is an open-source Raspberry Pi shield that measures biosignals such as those used in electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiography (ECG).

BrainFlow supports PiEEG directly on the Raspberry Pi and gets data straight from the board. If you want to stream data to PC you should use our [Streming Board](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SupportedBoards.html#streaming-board) on PC and PiEEG board on Raspberry Pi.

In order to use it you have to compile BrainFlow directly on Raspberry Pi first, because we don't provide precompiled binaries as of right now for it. And you need to provide `-–build-periphery` flag to `build.py` script or enable `-DBUILD_PERIPHERY=ON` CMake option. After that you should install desired bindings using local binaries, more info about compilation process can be found [here](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/BuildBrainFlow.html#compilation-of-core-module-and-c-binding) and [here](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/BuildBrainFlow.html#python).

Once it's done, you should be able to use all standard BrainFlow examples with `BoardIds.PIEEG_BOARD`.

```python
import time

from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams, BoardIds

def main():
    BoardShim.enable_board_logger()

    params = BrainFlowInputParams() 
    board = BoardShim(BoardIds.PIEEG_BOARD, params)
    board.prepare_session()
    board.start_stream()
    time.sleep(10)    
    data = board.get_board_data()
    board.stop_stream()
    board.release_session()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Thanks [Nick Gamb](https://github.com/nickgamb) for the help with integration!

## New manylinux Docker containers

CentOS reached EOL, so manylinux docker container which we used before is no longer available. We had to bump the version and as a result minimal supported GLIBC version is 2.28. If you use Linux distribution with older GLIBC version and cannot update it you should use previous BrainFlow releases. More info about manylinux containers can be found [here](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow/pull/732).
